I am a cyber security professional. My main focus is security engineering, defence operations, streamlining cyber security process to be more efficient and secure. 

I want to create the personal website. Choose a easy maintainance project that can fulfilled all my requests. Like docusaurus. This will be absorb into a mono repo in future. So make it compatible.

The website is hosted with gitlab.io and linked to my domain on "aungmmtech.info". My linkedin profile is linkedin.com/in/aungmm.

- Need to look professional
- Material and minimalic theme
- Light/Dark Theme must be supported
- Fonts must be monolithic

Features

- I want a place to display all my other projects dynamically linked.
- I want to put a display page where I can show off all my contributions like talks, presentations in conferences.
- I want to display a section where I can  post my hobbies related things, like vlogs, notes, articles, etc.
